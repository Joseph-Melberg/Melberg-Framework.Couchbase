# Melberg-Framework.Couchbase
Couchbase implementation for Melberg-Framework

# Overview

An very opinionated couchbase package that trades security for ease of use.  Given a couchbase user with administration rights, it creates a bucket as detailed in the appsettings.json and creates collections as requested by the BaseRepository implementations.
